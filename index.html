        The code hidden on the main menu is pseudocode, but written by Heckteck
        so it is probably logical in it's function and operator use. Ultrakill
        is made in Unity, and Unity's primary language is C# so this is probably
        also C# based or at least C#-ish pseudocode with some creative
        liberties.
      </p>

      <h2>The Libraries</h2>
      <p>
        When we write code, it is possible to import code from other files,
        usually because it's a file full of useful functions that we want to use
        multiple times but only write once, we call these libraries. You can
        import a whole library <strong>or</strong> by uses braces (These things
        ->{ }) you can pick which functions you want to pull out of the library.
        Naturally the decoded library name that we import from is a clue as to
        the contextual use of the functions listed.
      </p>

      <h3>above &amp; so</h3>
      <p>
        The Library name <strong>Trismegistus</strong> points us to Hermes
        Trigsmestus the father of
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism" target="_blank"
          >Hermeticism</a
        >
        and what would eventually evolve into Alchemy. one of his most prolific
        works is the Emerald Tablet, which besides declaring his rules of the
        universe is the origin of the phrase <i>"As Above So Below".</i>
      </p>
      <pre><span style="color: rgb(220, 198, 224); font-weight: 400;">void</span>* below = x =&gt; compose(so, () =&gt; above)(x);</pre>
      <p>
        The compose() function in a lot of languages takes multiple functions
        glues them all toegether and returns them as a single function that does
        all the functions in order. So this line is creating a function called
        below that takes an argument called x then apparently making it the same
        as whatever above is. So surprise surprise. <i>"As above, so below"</i>.
        Or for the purposes of ultrakill
        <i>"That which is in heaven, is also in hell"</i>This will be important
        later.
      </p>

      <h3>permutation, transmutation &amp; exhalation</h3>
      <p>
        The Library name <strong>principle</strong> along with one of the
        functions being transmutation points us towards the processes of
        alchemy, specifically the 3 principles of alchemy are
        <strong>Salt</strong>, <strong>Sulfur</strong> and
        <strong>Mercury</strong>. Alchemy changed a lot over the centuries and
        the theories evolved but by the 16th century it was put forward by an
        alchemist called Paracelsus that all matter in the world consisted of
        these 3 principles, the <i>tria prima</i>, in different ratios. The
        principles have innate properties that will manifest in matter based on
        the ratio of principles in said matter.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Sulfur</strong> is hot and dry, It is evaporation and
          expansion. It's symbol is <span class="!text-2xl">&#128781;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mercury</strong> is cold and wet. It is fusibility and
          volatility. It's symbol is <span class="!text-2xl">&#9791;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Salt</strong> is hard and inert. It is stability and
          structure. It's symbol is <span class="!text-2xl"> &#128788;</span>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This manifests in games with the new look skull keys. The skulls come in
        red, blue and now white and now carry alchemical symbols. This may be a
        connection to the menu pseudocode but this hasn't been confirmed and
        regardless is at least in part to make the game more accessible for
        colorblind people.

          />
          <p>
            The red skull is <strong>sulfur</strong>. It's altar is a triangle
            and when you put a red skull on it, it heats up hot coals and begins
            to sizzle.
          </p>

          />
          <p>
            The blue skull is <strong>mercury</strong>. It's altar is a is round
            and when you put a blue skull on it, it fills with fluid.
          </p>

          <p>
            The white skull is <strong>salt</strong>. It's altar is a is
            hexagonal with a line through it. There have been no gettable
            instances of the skull in the game but since the update it has been
            added all over the place as parts of level decoration and there are
            files in the games assets that support them working as the other
            keys.

      <p>
        So why are we pulling functions from a library named
        <strong>princple</strong> if these aren't the princples. Because so far
        we have just been importing functions. So they aren't the principles,
        they are things we can do to the principles.

          <strong>Transmutation</strong> is the alchemical term for one matter
          being turned into another matter through manipulation, burning,
          boiling, washing with acids etc. This one is easy. Transmutation and
          alchemy go hand in hand. <br />

          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Exhalation</strong> is a little more obscure. As said before,
          Alchemy and it's terms and theories evolved over thousands of years.
          Parcelsus's <i>tria prima</i> idea was built on the work of centuries.
          Long before, a greek philosopher called Aristotle published writings
          on his explanations for why the world was the way it was. The writings
          spanned multiple books, collectively called
          <strong>Meteorlogica</strong>. He covered all kinds of things but for
          our purposes we are interested in book 3.
          <blockquote class="w-10/12 mx-auto my-8">
            <p class="italic">
              We maintain that there are two exhalations, one vaporous the other
              smoky, and there correspond two kinds of bodies that originate in
              the earth, 'fossiles' and metals. The heat of the dry exhalation
              is the cause of all 'fossiles'[...] The vaporous exhalation is the
              cause of all metals [...] Their dryness compresses it, and it
              congeals just as dew or hoar-frost does when it has been separated
              off, though in the present case the metals are generated before
              that segregation occurs.
            </p>
            <span class="float-right"> ~ Aristotle</span>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="italic py-8">What?</p>
          <p>
            You may notice here 3 interesting terms used. Exhalation, vapourous
            and smoky. Simply put, Aristotle refers to exhalations multiples
            times whenever he talks about the movement of air. He uses it for
            wind, but also the movement generated by heat rising. Alchemists
            over the years to come would interpret his writings as claiming that
            all metals and minerals in the earth are caused by exhalations from
            the earth the exhalations are either sulfurous smokes or mercurial
            vapours and their combinations formed everything they found in the
            ground from gold to granite.
          </p>
          <span class="text-center block font-black mb-6"
            >This is the function for acquiring a substance.</span
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Permutation</strong> is not strictly an alchemical action.
          Permutation is a mathematical term that takes a set of items (say for
          example the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4) and then figures out how many ways
          that set can be organised in a unique order. Permutation is where the
          alchemical touches the digital, if this code is to perform some form
          of alchemy it needs to be automated, permutations gives the code
          multiple combinations of matter to mess with.

      </ul>
      <h3>blood &amp; formal_blood</h3>
      <p>
        Blood plays a large part in ultrakill's world, it is the source of all
        life, even if you can move, speak and think, if you do not have blood,
        you are not alive. Not everything that has blood is alive, but
        everything that is alive has blood. It appears that the womb here is
        literal. A container from which life can spring, maybe it's some
        horrific machine or a weird relic, cool to think about. But why are
        there two things? Why is blood different than formal_blood? To explore
        this we will begin to look at some of the other functions that we
        skipped earlier.
      </p>

      <pre><span style="color: rgb(220, 198, 224); font-weight: 400;">void</span>* reify = partial_apply(below, transmutation);
<span style="color: rgb(220, 198, 224); font-weight: 400;">void</span>* deify = <span style="color: rgb(245, 171, 53); font-weight: 400;">#MACRO_INVERT(x) partial_apply(reify, x);</span>

<span style="color: rgb(248, 248, 242); font-weight: 400;">typedef <span style="color: rgb(0, 224, 224); font-weight: 400;">matter</span>(<span style="color: rgb(245, 171, 53); font-weight: 400;">t_form</span>)</span> = <span style="color: rgb(245, 171, 53); font-weight: 400;">#DERIVE reify(t_form);</span></pre>
      <p>
        These functions can be initially confusing, and can if misinterpreted
        lead you down the wrong path. Deify does not technically reference the
        divine, formal_blood is not formal in the way a 3 piece suit is formal.
        All this code refers to the work of <strong>Plato</strong> and his
        <strong>Theory of Forms</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="italic py-8">Again, what?</p>
      <p>
        Plato's theory of forms was one of the early attempts to broker concepts
        of what reality even is. The theory of forms is big and complicated, but
        for the sake of this mystery we only need to know 2 things. Two of the
        main forms that anything can be is the <i>ideal form</i> and the
        <i>platonic form</i>. Put your thinking caps on.
      </p>
      <p>
        An ideal form is something that isn't physical, you cannot hold it,
        create it, destroy it etc. but you know what it is. Some examples of
        ideal forms are beauty, mathematics, wisdom, violence. You can look at
        multiple beautiful objects and each object may be utterly different from
        the last but they all possess the form of beauty.
      </p>
      <p>
        A platonic form is easier. A platonic form could be an object. It could
        be physical, it could be created it could be destroyed. A hat is a
        platonic form, so is a planet and a gun. No platonic forms exist because
        our universe is too chaotic for anything to be created at that level of
        purity, but what matters is that it technically could, but it never
        will.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this context when we look at blood and formal_blood this now makes
        more sense. Blood is blood, the red goopy liquid we all love and keep in
        our bodies for fun and profit. Formal blood is the perfect form of blood
        beyond the physical. It is blood outside of limitations of space and
        time it is the most blood that blood can be.
      </p>
      <p>
        But forms don't do anything, they just exist, so now we need to do
        something with them. This is where reify and deify come in.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>reify</strong> takes something, mixes it with substances from
          within hell, commonly referred to as "hell matter" in game lore and
          applies alchemical transmutation to them to make them real within the
          physical world. The world reify is actually used in the theory of
          forms as something you cannot do. To reify something is to take the
          abstract, perfect form of a thing and treat it like it's a real
          physical object which as we've established you cannot do to forms.
          They cannot exist in our universe. Yet here we are reifying forms of
          things through alchemy. This is confirmed by the typedef (type
          definition. By defining a type you are saying "this is a type of
          thing, all things of the same type will follow the same rules and
          behave the same way.") line. It defines matter. Matter as in
          everything our physical reality is made out of every atom and molecule
          of our universe. #DERIVE usually means to basically do whatever you're
          deriving to the type you're defining. So if you're going to do stuff
          to matter with this code, it must be made real through transmutation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>deify</strong> does not refer to deity, or at least not
          literally. The function in simple terms does the opposite of reify.
          But whereas reify only applies to below, ergo all that is in hell.
          Deify applies to all that is in heaven AND hell (scroll up to the
          Trismegistus bit about as above so below) and casts it as an ideal
          form outside of reality.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Ready for Heresy</h2>
      <p>
        So now we have gone through and investigated the first part of the
        pseudocode. This code gives us a source of substances with which to
        perform alchemy. It gives us tools to do alchemy to those substances,
        and it it gives us blood that we're going to do something to. Probably
        something horrible.
